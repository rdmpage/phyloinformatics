# Plan

Go through web site, look at examples,

- have them find information on species

- list sites on a Google Docs spreadsheet (what sites are there, do they have an API, is there an R package?)

- show accessing different types of data (HTML, XML, JSON)

- look at contributing data (e.g., iNaturalist)
